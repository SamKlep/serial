        Serial killers that see outsmarting the law as some sort of amusement.
        They enjoy attention from the media and they also enjoy being pursued by
        the police. They can be distinguished from other serial killers because
        of the fact that they send messages to others and they keep detailed
        records of their killings. Because of this, it is logical to say that
        most thrill seekers can be categorized as organized, but at the same
        time they do not always plan everything out in advance. For that, they
        are also seen as unorganized killers. Thrills seekers typically use
        weapons and/or rape their victims before killing them. After that, they
        hide the victim's corpse and they move on to their next victim, that is,
        unless of course they are caught in the act of doing so.
