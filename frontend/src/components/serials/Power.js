        Serial killers enjoy their victim's terror, suffering and screaming.
        These killers tend to be very organized and they usually have a history
        of childhood abuse, which left them feeling powerless and inadequete as
        adults. Many of these killers also sexually abuse their victims, but
        they are not motivated by feelings of lust. To them, rape is simply
        another form of dominating the victim.
