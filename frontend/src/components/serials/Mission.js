        Serial killers are killers that feel that they are doing society a favor
        by ridding it of certain people; these can include young women,
        prostitutes, drug dealers, or homosexuals, people they feel that society
        could do without. These killers are generally not psychotic. Some see
        themselves as trying to change society. They always have a controlled
        crime scene, hence categorizing them as organized makes them much easier
        to track. However, since these killers always go after specific victims,
        this makes them much easier to track down.
