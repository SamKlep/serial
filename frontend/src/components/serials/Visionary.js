        People that occaisionally suffer from psychotic breaks from society.
        They sometimes believe they are another person, or they are compelled to
        murder by higher entities such as God or the Devil. In fact, the two
        most common subcategories for visionary serial killers are
        demon-mandated and God-mandated. David Berkowitz is an example of such a
        killer. He had claimed that a demon transmitted orders to him through
        his neighbor's dog that told him to kill. Since visionary killers tend
        to be more unorganized than other killers, they are very easy to track
        down.
