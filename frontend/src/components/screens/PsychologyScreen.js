                The term ‘serial killer’ strikes fear deep into the hearts of
                most. However it is often thought that fear is what drives some
                curiosities, thus finding it appropriate to understand why
                serial killers commit horrific acts of violence repetitively. It
                has been found that many serial killers encompass similars
                emotional development issues. They also tend to be above-average
                intelligence wise, and in some ways it is as if killing acts as
                a drug for some of these men. Many theories of crime and
                deviance correlate to the actions of serial killers. Studies of
                known serial killers have unveiled similarities between them as
                early as infancy. Infancy, childhood and relationships with
                one’s mother are often among the key parallels of serial killers
                (Vronsky 2004).

                Infancy is one of the most significant stages in the development
                of the human. Emotionally, infancy is crucial to the proper
                development of the adult personality (Vronsky 2004). The first
                twelve months are especially critical to the development of
                emotions such as remorse and affection. If a child does not
                receive adequate attention and physical touch during this time
                period they may suffer substantial personality disorders in the
                future (Canter 2005). In fact, there may be signs that the child
                has a psychopathic personality by the age of 2 (Vronsky 2004).
                The infant develops a sense of only itself. This is indicated by
                the absence of a range of emotions such as sympathy, remorse,
                and affection (Leyton 1987).

                Childhood trauma has also been linked to serial killers. Studies
                have revealed a number of significant statistics supporting the
                idea that mental and physical trauma may have long lasting
                effects upon an individual (Aynesworth 1999). 42% of convicted
                serial killers suffered from physical abuse as children 74%
                suffered from psychological abuse (Aynesworth 1999). Sexual
                abuse also seemed to be a prominent characteristic among serial
                killers as 35% witnessed sexual abuse and 43% were sexually
                abused themselves (Aynesworth 1999). Another form of physical
                trauma linked to serial killers is head trauma. 29% of serial
                killers were found to be ‘accident prone children’ (Aynesworth
                1999). The compilation of these factors leads many sociologists
                to view psychopathic behavior as the brain’s defense mechanism
                (Aynesworth 1999).

                As does infancy, early childhood is key to the formation of a
                serial killer. Commonly, serial killers were isolated from their
                peers as children (Vronsky 2004). Many serial killers suffered
                from weight problems, stutters and learning problems such as
                dyslexia (Moesch 1998). Due to bullying, many of these serial
                killers began harboring “secret aggressive fantasies” (Vronsky
                2004). As stated by David Berkowitz also known as the Son of
                Sam, “It was a mysterious force working against me. I felt
                bothered and tormented, ‘Die Schmutz’ [Yiddish for ‘the dirty
                one’].” (Vronsky 2004). It is clear that aggression begins in
                early childhood. Loneliness, as illustrated, may lead to the
                evolution of fantasies as these ‘serial killers in- the- making’
                are frequently alone.

                Another common characteristic among serial killers is their
                relationship with their mother. The mothers of these ‘monsters’
                tend to breed men that hate females (Moesch 1998). The mothers
                may be over controlling, overprotective, physically abusive and
                emotionally abusive (Moesch 1998). According to one
                psychologist, Sigmund Freud, males try to reach autonomy with
                their mother. If the child is unsuccessful this will result in
                rage (Moesch 1998). Many feminists disdain the idea of the
                mother assisting in the creation of a serial killer. Feminists
                argue that it is just another way for men to blame women for
                their downfalls, somewhat of a ‘blame it on the mother” scenario
                (Moesch 1998). This notion is empirically supported to an extent
                however as 66% of known serial killers were raised with the
                mother as the dominant figure (Moesch 1998).

                Childhood trauma has also been linked to serial killers. Studies
                have revealed a number of significant statistics supporting the
                idea that mental and physical trauma may have long lasting

                The emphasis upon infancy and early childhood may align serial
                killers with the Biological Trait Theories. These theories focus
                upon biological conditions that may control human behaviors.
                Neurophysiology is the study of brain function. It has uncovered
                neurological and physical abnormalities that may begin as early
                as the prenatal stage in some humans. There have been links
                between the impairment of executive brain function and
                aggression through such research (Aynesworth 1999). Many of the
                serial killers discussed have been labeled with some sort of
                neurological disorder. Thus, these repetitive serial killers may
                just be reacting to chemicals and hereditary factors in their
                brains rather than on pure evil.

                Another Criminological theory that may apply to serial killers
                is the Psychodynamic theory. According to Sigmund Freud the
                development of the unconscious personality early in childhood
                will influence behavior for the rest of one’s life. In short,
                negative experiences act as” residue” from early childhood.
                Freud believes that the human develops, early in life, three
                aspects of their personality. These include the id, the ego and
                the superego (Seltzer 1995). The id is considered to be
                primitive, supplying unconscious drives for food and sex. The
                ego is formed as sort of a guide to remain aligned with
                societies norms. Finally the superego develops incorporating
                values and morals. Thus, serial killers seem to be overwhelmed
                by their id. This would explain why people such as David
                Berkowitz would become a serial killer. He did not receive
                proper care as an infant and child, most likely due to his
                adoption, thus he was negatively affected into adulthood.
                According to the psychodynamic theory crime occurs when a person
                displays a weak ego. In short, serial killers seem to be
                manifesting their feelings of oppression from childhood in the
                form of brutal murders.

                According to this theory the organized offender is thought of as
                leading an organized, average life. He is also thought to have
                average to above average intelligence, skilled employment and he
                is socially competent. These characteristics are deciphered from
                the crime scene left by an “organized offender”. The crime scene
                of such an offender suggests that the killer planned his attack,
                bringing a weapon with him as well as bringing it with him when
                he leaves. The organized serial killer is also careful not to
                leave blood and finger prints behind. The organized serial
                killer is thought to be killing as some sort of reaction to a
                stressful event (Canter 2004).

            <div>
              <p>
                In contrast to the organized serial killer there is the
                disorganized serial killer according to this theory. The
                disorganized killer leaves the crime scene just as the name
                suggests; in disarray. The disorganized offender is likely to
                leave blood, fingerprints and the murder weapon behind (Canter
                2004). The killing is thought to be opportunistic and often
                occurs close to where the offender lives (Canter 2004).
                Characteristically, the disorganized killer is thought to be
                socially inadequate and have below-average intelligence. They
                are believed to struggle with maintaining social relationships
                (Canter 2004). This aspect of the organized/disorganized theory
                is somewhat similar to the idea of the social control theory.
                This theory also states that limited stakes in conventional
                society may lead to criminal behavior.

                The psychology of the serial killer is intriguing yet
                frightening. The decay of these offenders’ personalities begins
                at infancy for many and continues through childhood and into
                adulthood. The serial killer tends to be neglected during
                significant stages of infancy, where in which the development of
                the human personality begins. As these offenders enter childhood
                they are still at a disadvantage socially, often as a result of
                abuse and parental issues. Serial killers often lack self
                control, as well as other critical characteristics of a law
                abiding citizen. It seems as if socialization plays a large roll
                in the formation of these monsters. A number of other
                criminological theories can be applied to the serial killer in
                some form, however there are still anomalies. The Biological
                Trait Theories, Psychodynamic theory, and the
                Organized/Disorganized theory all attempt to explain the
                inexplicable actions of serial killers. The biological trait
                theories apply as there is great emphasis on infancy and
                childhood emotional growth. The psychodynamic theory applies as
                well as these men display actions that seem to be driven by
                their id personality. Lastly, the organized/disorganized theory
                attempts to conclude personality and behavioral characteristics
                from crime scene investigation.
