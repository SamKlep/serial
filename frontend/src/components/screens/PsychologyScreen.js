              The term ‘serial killer’ strikes fear deep into the hearts of
              most. However it is often thought that fear is what drives some
              curiosities, thus finding it appropriate to understand why serial
              killers commit horrific acts of violence repetitively. It has been
              found that many serial killers encompass similars emotional
              development issues. They also tend to be above-average
              intelligence wise, and in some ways it is as if killing acts as a
              drug for some of these men. Many theories of crime and deviance
              correlate to the actions of serial killers. Studies of known
              serial killers have unveiled similarities between them as early as
              infancy. Infancy, childhood and relationships with one’s mother
              are often among the key parallels of serial killers (Vronsky
              2004).

                Infancy is one of the most significant stages in the development
                of the human. Emotionally, infancy is crucial to the proper
                development of the adult personality (Vronsky 2004). The first
                twelve months are especially critical to the development of
                emotions such as remorse and affection. If a child does not
                receive adequate attention and physical touch during this time
                period they may suffer substantial personality disorders in the
                future (Canter 2005). In fact, there may be signs that the child
                has a psychopathic personality by the age of 2 (Vronsky 2004).
                The infant develops a sense of only itself. This is indicated by
                the absence of a range of emotions such as sympathy, remorse,
                and affection (Leyton 1987).

                Childhood trauma has also been linked to serial killers. Studies
                have revealed a number of significant statistics supporting the
                idea that mental and physical trauma may have long lasting
                effects upon an individual (Aynesworth 1999). 42% of convicted
                serial killers suffered from physical abuse as children 74%
                suffered from psychological abuse (Aynesworth 1999). Sexual
                abuse also seemed to be a prominent characteristic among serial
                killers as 35% witnessed sexual abuse and 43% were sexually
                abused themselves (Aynesworth 1999). Another form of physical
                trauma linked to serial killers is head trauma. 29% of serial
                killers were found to be ‘accident prone children’ (Aynesworth
                1999). The compilation of these factors leads many sociologists
                to view psychopathic behavior as the brain’s defense mechanism
                (Aynesworth 1999).

                As does infancy, early childhood is key to the formation of a
                serial killer. Commonly, serial killers were isolated from their
                peers as children (Vronsky 2004). Many serial killers suffered
                from weight problems, stutters and learning problems such as
                dyslexia (Moesch 1998). Due to bullying, many of these serial
                killers began harboring “secret aggressive fantasies” (Vronsky
                2004). As stated by David Berkowitz also known as the Son of
                Sam, “It was a mysterious force working against me. I felt
                bothered and tormented, ‘Die Schmutz’ [Yiddish for ‘the dirty
                one’].” (Vronsky 2004). It is clear that aggression begins in
                early childhood. Loneliness, as illustrated, may lead to the
                evolution of fantasies as these ‘serial killers in- the- making’
                are frequently alone.

              Another common characteristic among serial killers is their
              relationship with their mother. The mothers of these ‘monsters’
              tend to breed men that hate females (Moesch 1998). The mothers may
              be over controlling, overprotective, physically abusive and
              emotionally abusive (Moesch 1998). According to one psychologist,
              Sigmund Freud, males try to reach autonomy with their mother. If
              the child is unsuccessful this will result in rage (Moesch 1998).
              Many feminists disdain the idea of the mother assisting in the
              creation of a serial killer. Feminists argue that it is just
              another way for men to blame women for their downfalls, somewhat
              of a ‘blame it on the mother” scenario (Moesch 1998). This notion
              is empirically supported to an extent however as 66% of known
              serial killers were raised with the mother as the dominant figure
              (Moesch 1998).

                Childhood trauma has also been linked to serial killers. Studies
                have revealed a number of significant statistics supporting the
                idea that mental and physical trauma may have long lasting
                effects upon an individual (Aynesworth 1999). 42% of convicted
                serial killers suffered from physical abuse as children 74%
                suffered from psychological abuse (Aynesworth 1999). Sexual
                abuse also seemed to be a prominent characteristic among serial
                killers as 35% witnessed sexual abuse and 43% were sexually
                abused themselves (Aynesworth 1999). Another form of physical
                trauma linked to serial killers is head trauma. 29% of serial
                killers were found to be ‘accident prone children’ (Aynesworth

                (Aynesworth 1999).

                The emphasis upon infancy and early childhood may align serial
                killers with the Biological Trait Theories. These theories focus
                upon biological conditions that may control human behaviors.
                Neurophysiology is the study of brain function. It has uncovered
                neurological and physical abnormalities that may begin as early
                as the prenatal stage in some humans. There have been links
                between the impairment of executive brain function and
                aggression through such research (Aynesworth 1999). Many of the
                serial killers discussed have been labeled with some sort of
                neurological disorder. Thus, these repetitive serial killers may
                just be reacting to chemicals and hereditary factors in their
                brains rather than on pure evil.

                Another Criminological theory that may apply to serial killers
                is the Psychodynamic theory. According to Sigmund Freud the
                development of the unconscious personality early in childhood
                will influence behavior for the rest of one’s life. In short,
                negative experiences act as” residue” from early childhood.
                Freud believes that the human develops, early in life, three
                aspects of their personality. These include the id, the ego and
                the superego (Seltzer 1995). The id is considered to be
                primitive, supplying unconscious drives for food and sex. The
                ego is formed as sort of a guide to remain aligned with
                societies norms. Finally the superego develops incorporating
                values and morals. Thus, serial killers seem to be overwhelmed
                by their id. This would explain why people such as David
                Berkowitz would become a serial killer. He did not receive
                proper care as an infant and child, most likely due to his
                adoption, thus he was negatively affected into adulthood.
                According to the psychodynamic theory crime occurs when a person
                displays a weak ego. In short, serial killers seem to be
                manifesting their feelings of oppression from childhood in the
                form of brutal murders.

              According to this theory the organized offender is thought of as
              leading an organized, average life. He is also thought to have
              average to above average intelligence, skilled employment and he
              is socially competent. These characteristics are deciphered from
              the crime scene left by an “organized offender”. The crime scene
              of such an offender suggests that the killer planned his attack,
              bringing a weapon with him as well as bringing it with him when he
              leaves. The organized serial killer is also careful not to leave
              blood and finger prints behind. The organized serial killer is
              thought to be killing as some sort of reaction to a stressful
              event (Canter 2004).

            <p>
              In contrast to the organized serial killer there is the
              disorganized serial killer according to this theory. The
              disorganized killer leaves the crime scene just as the name
              suggests; in disarray. The disorganized offender is likely to
              leave blood, fingerprints and the murder weapon behind (Canter
              2004). The killing is thought to be opportunistic and often occurs
              close to where the offender lives (Canter 2004).
              Characteristically, the disorganized killer is thought to be
              socially inadequate and have below-average intelligence. They are
              believed to struggle with maintaining social relationships (Canter
              2004). This aspect of the organized/disorganized theory is
              somewhat similar to the idea of the social control theory. This
              theory also states that limited stakes in conventional society may
              lead to criminal behavior.

              The psychology of the serial killer is intriguing yet frightening.
              The decay of these offenders’ personalities begins at infancy for
              many and continues through childhood and into adulthood. The
              serial killer tends to be neglected during significant stages of
              infancy, where in which the development of the human personality
              begins. As these offenders enter childhood they are still at a
              disadvantage socially, often as a result of abuse and parental
              issues. Serial killers often lack self control, as well as other
              critical characteristics of a law abiding citizen. It seems as if
              socialization plays a large roll in the formation of these
              monsters. A number of other criminological theories can be applied
              to the serial killer in some form, however there are still
              anomalies. The Biological Trait Theories, Psychodynamic theory,
              and the Organized/Disorganized theory all attempt to explain the
              inexplicable actions of serial killers. The biological trait
              theories apply as there is great emphasis on infancy and childhood
              emotional growth. The psychodynamic theory applies as well as
              these men display actions that seem to be driven by their id
              personality. Lastly, the organized/disorganized theory attempts to
              conclude personality and behavioral characteristics from crime
              scene investigation.

              The term ‘serial killer’ strikes fear deep into the hearts of
              most. However it is often thought that fear is what drives some
              curiosities, thus finding it appropriate to understand why serial
              killers commit horrific acts of violence repetitively. It has been
              found that many serial killers encompass similars emotional
              development issues. They also tend to be above-average
              intelligence wise, and in some ways it is as if killing acts as a
              drug for some of these men. Many theories of crime and deviance
              correlate to the actions of serial killers. Studies of known
              serial killers have unveiled similarities between them as early as
              infancy. Infancy, childhood and relationships with one’s mother
              are often among the key parallels of serial killers (Vronsky
              2004).
