              Our species has barely gone past our own planet's moon, and only
              one of our probes, Voyager 1, has even left the solar system. Much
              of what we've learned about deep space has been pieced together
              from falling objects and views from telescopes.

              Some of the famous (and chilling) space mysteries, like the face
              on Mars (it was shadows), or the black knight satellite "UFO"
              (it's satellite debris), have been solved.

              Black holes are the ultimate cosmic quicksand. They're formed when
              a giant star collapses, imploding into a tiny area of such intense
              gravity, even the surrounding light is sucked in.
            </p>
            <p className='mb-5 ml-5'>
              This means that although we've got a sense of how black holes
              work, we've still never actually seen one â€” they're invisible to
              telescopes that pick up electromagnetic radiation, light, or
              X-rays. We can only guess what they look like on the inside.
